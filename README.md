## What is PEC 55?

Constitutional Amendment Proposal (PEC) is a mechanism to amend parts of the text of the constitution. PEC 55 was proposed in 2016 by the Brazilian president, Michel Temer, the Usurper, and approved by the Brazilian Congress in the same year. Using the economic crisis as justification, PEC 55 proposes to reduce primary public spending (health, education, social security, culture, transportation, etc.) to pay interest on debt and increase investor confidence in the country. This view is not a consensus among economists and hides what is really at stake, the liberal desire to reduce the state, contrary to what was established by the Brazilian Constitution of 1988 and what was elected by popular vote. PEC 55 proposes to deal with the economic crisis by passing over collective interests and the poorest population. This does not encourage the end of the recession, does not increase revenue, does not affect the debt system, in addition to maintaining the scandalous transfer of public resources to the private sector.
